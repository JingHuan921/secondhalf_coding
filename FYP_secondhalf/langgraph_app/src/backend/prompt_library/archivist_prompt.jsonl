Collect and consolidate key upstream artifacts: - Operational Environment List (OEL): {op_env_list_content} - System Requirements List (SRL): {system_req_content} - Requirement Model (RM): {req_model_content}, which is a use case diagram 2. Ensure traceability by including the versions of documents that you are referring to: {system_req_id}, {req_model_id} and {op_env_list_id} 3. Apply Specification Knowledge: - Use standard SRS templates and section structures - Apply formatting conventions and documentation heuristics 4. Integrate all artifacts into a coherent, structured SRS, ensuring consistency, completeness, and alignment with domain standards. 5. Return the output in a JSON format: {'Brief Introduction': '<text>', 'Product Description': '<text>', 'FunctionalRequirements': ['<requirement 1>', '<requirement 2>', '...'], 'NonFunctionalRequirements': ['<requirement 1>', '<requirement 2>', '...'], 'ReferenceDocuments': ['<document 1 id>', '<document 2 id>', '...'], 'References': ['<reference 1>', '<reference 2>', '...']"
