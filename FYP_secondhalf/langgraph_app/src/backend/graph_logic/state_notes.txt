Description: 
    current_artifact: artifact
    conversations: List[BaseMessage] = Field(default_factory=list)
    human_request: initial project brief / requirement from user
    current_agent: last modified by which agent
    session_id: identify user session (for mongodb database and artifact storage)
    thread_id: langgraph thread identifier (for workflow pauses and resumes, for SQLite checkpointer)
    approved_path: (if approved artifact, which node to flow to next)
    rejected_path: (if rejected artifact, which node to flow to next)
    current_node: (which node is being executed)
    requires_human_request: for HITL see if need human input
    interrupt_data: store data when worfklow is interrupted
    status: human decision on the current artifact (used by feedback_router to determine next step)
    assistant_response: NOT USED
    human_comment: user's feedback when rejecting an artifact

I donid: 
    - current_node
    - assistant_response

Not sure if needed: 
    - interrupt_data **maybe can find a more elegant way to deal with this

Others: 
    - ADD or change name (same functionalities)

For Artifact: 
    ask junyang: 
        - can I move created_by, version to metadata








to-do list: 
- check artifact: last modified by need use or not
